Hi there! I'm Wasik, currently working as a data scientist at [Orbund LLC](https://orbund.com). I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh and an alumnus of [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu)'s CSE Department.

I'm fueled by a fascination with how data can be used to understand the world around us. I am professionally active in the data science related domain since 2020. From creating dashboard to building end-to-end machine learning project, I've enjoyed the challange of adapting my expertise to different domains - data analytics, nlp, computer vision, tradtional ml

I am not a workaholic, I believe in work-life balance strongly. Small things count a lot in life, right? In my free time I like to play video games, watch movies and football, listen to music, read books ... so a little bit of everything. Video games would be the winner here though.

This is just a glimpse into my world. I'm constantly learning and growing, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for this fascinating field!

Feel free to give me a knock if you want to collaborate or just chat about tech/video games/ football !
